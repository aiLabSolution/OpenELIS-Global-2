**Feature Branch**: `005-eqa-module` **Generated**: 2025-11-14 **Spec Version**:
Draft

## Specification Quality Validation

### Completeness

- [x] User scenarios are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) with clear justification
- [x] Each user story is independently testable with specific test descriptions
- [x] Acceptance scenarios use Given/When/Then format
- [x] Edge cases are comprehensive and cover critical failure modes
- [x] Functional requirements are numbered and categorized (FR-001 through
      FR-053)
- [x] Constitution compliance requirements explicitly mapped to CR-001 through
      CR-008
- [x] UI/UX requirements specify Carbon Design System components (UI-001 through
      UI-012)
- [x] Key entities defined with attributes and relationships
- [x] Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (SC-001 through
      SC-015)
- [x] All 7 user stories have complete acceptance scenarios

### Clarity

- [x] Feature name is descriptive: "External Quality Assurance (EQA) Module"
- [x] User stories use plain language without technical jargon
- [x] Functional requirements use MUST/MUST NOT language consistently
- [x] Edge cases pose questions and provide clear answers
- [x] Entity definitions avoid implementation details (no column types/indexes)

- [x] No ambiguous requirements marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

### Constitution Alignment (OpenELIS Global 3.0)

- [x] **CR-001**: Carbon Design System components explicitly specified for all
      UI requirements
- [x] **CR-002**: React Intl internationalization requirement noted for all UI
      strings
- [x] **CR-003**: 5-layer architecture defined with specific
      entity/DAO/Service/Controller/Form names

- [x] **CR-005**: FHIR R4 integration specified for inter-laboratory result
      submissions
- [x] **CR-006**: Configuration-driven approach for EQA programs, thresholds,
      statistical parameters
- [x] **CR-007**: RBAC (EQA coordinator role), audit trail (sys_user_id +
      lastupdated), input validation
- [x] **CR-008**: Test coverage requirements specified (>70% unit, >60%
      integration, E2E for critical journeys)

### Technical Feasibility

- [x] Extends existing Order entity rather than creating parallel sample
      tracking system
- [x] Leverages existing organizations management for participants and providers
- [x] Integrates with existing shipment/box functionality for distribution
- [x] Reuses existing barcode generation and labeling systems
- [x] Statistical calculations (Z-scores) use industry-standard formulas
- [x] Alert system designed to be extensible beyond EQA (STAT orders, sample
      expiration, critical results)
- [x] FHIR API integration aligns with existing referral system patterns
- [x] No novel or unproven technical approaches required

- [x] Work queue generation and filtering
- [x] Existing Order entity extension

- [x] Barcode generation system
- [x] FHIR integration infrastructure
- [x] User role and permission system

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks (P1)

- **EQA Deadline Alert Reliability**: Alerts must generate with 99.9% accuracy
  across timezones
  - _Mitigation_: Use UTC storage, comprehensive timezone conversion testing,
    automated cron job monitoring
- **Statistical Calculation Accuracy**: Z-score calculations must follow
  industry standards
  - _Mitigation_: Unit tests with known test data, peer review of formulas,
    validation against manual calculations
- **Patient Data Privacy**: EQA samples must never contain real patient
  information
  - _Mitigation_: Automated validation to enforce "N/A" in demographics when
    is_eqa_sample=true, E2E tests to verify

### Medium Priority Risks (P2)

- **Performance with High Alert Volume**: Dashboard must handle 200+ active
  alerts
  - _Mitigation_: Pagination, server-side filtering, database indexing on alert
    queries, load testing
- **FHIR API Interoperability**: Result submissions between different OpenELIS
  instances
  - _Mitigation_: FHIR R4 compliance validation, integration tests with mock
    endpoints, real-world pilot testing
- **Concurrent Result Submissions**: Multiple participants submitting
  simultaneously
  - _Mitigation_: Database transaction isolation, optimistic locking, concurrent
    load testing

### Low Priority Risks (P3)

- **CSV/Excel File Upload Validation**: Malformed batch result files
  - _Mitigation_: Robust validation with clear error messages, file format
    templates, comprehensive test data sets
- **Report Generation Performance**: Large distributions (50+ participants)
  - _Mitigation_: Asynchronous report generation for large data sets, pagination
    in reports, performance testing

## Validation Questions for Review

### Domain Logic Validation

- [ ] **Statistical Analysis**: Are the Z-score thresholds (≤2.0 Acceptable,
      2.0-3.0 Questionable, >3.0 Unacceptable) aligned with WHO or CAP
      proficiency testing standards?
- [ ] **Minimum Participants**: Is 5 participants the appropriate minimum for
      statistical validity, or should this be configurable?
- [ ] **Alert Timing**: Are 72h/24h/4h alert intervals appropriate for all EQA
      programs, or should this be configurable per program?
- [ ] **Priority Processing**: Are the processing time targets (4h Critical, 24h
      Urgent, normal Standard) realistic for laboratory operations?

### User Experience Validation

- [ ] **Sample Registration Flow**: Does the 4-tab workflow with EQA checkbox on
      Tab 1 match technician mental models?
- [ ] **Alerts Dashboard Layout**: Does the summary tile + table design match
      existing OpenELIS pathology dashboard patterns?
- [ ] **Distribution Workflow**: Is the multi-step distribution creation
      intuitive for EQA coordinators?
- [ ] **Result Entry**: Are three submission methods (FHIR/Manual/File Upload)
      sufficient for all use cases?

### Technical Architecture Validation

- [ ] **Order Entity Extension**: Does extending Order with 6 new EQA fields
      create any schema migration risks?
- [ ] **Alert Escalation**: Is 4-hour escalation timer implemented as
      database-driven scheduled job or in-application logic?
- [ ] **FHIR Endpoints**: Do we need new FHIR resources or can we extend
      existing DiagnosticReport/ServiceRequest?
- [ ] **Report Generation**: Should PDF generation use existing OpenELIS report
      infrastructure or new library (iText, JasperReports)?

## Next Steps

1. **Clarification Phase** (`/speckit.clarify`):

   - Review validation questions above
   - Resolve any ambiguities in statistical thresholds, alert timing, or
     architecture decisions
   - Confirm alignment with WHO/CAP proficiency testing standards

2. **Planning Phase** (`/speckit.plan`):

   - Review constitution compliance for any conflicts
   - Design database schema with Liquibase changesets
   - Define API endpoints for EQA operations
   - Identify reusable components from existing features
   - Plan phased implementation (P1 stories → P2 stories → P3 stories)

3. **Task Breakdown** (`/speckit.tasks`):

   - Generate dependency-ordered task list
   - Identify TDD test-first tasks for statistical calculations
   - Plan database migrations before code changes
   - Schedule E2E test creation alongside feature development

4. **Implementation** (`/speckit.implement`):
   - Follow Red-Green-Refactor TDD cycle
   - Implement P1 user stories first (EQA sample registration + deadline alerts)
   - Run `mvn spotless:apply` before every commit
   - Execute individual E2E tests during development

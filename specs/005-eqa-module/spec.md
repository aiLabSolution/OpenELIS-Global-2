**Feature Branch**: `005-eqa-module` **Created**: 2025-11-14 **Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "External Quality Assurance (EQA) module for
proficiency testing"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-11-17

- Q: Does the Figma design include the priority level field
  (Standard/Urgent/Critical) required by FR-003 on the Program Selection screen?
  → A: Priority field already exists in implementation
- Q: Does "provider sample ID" in FR-003 refer to one field or two separate
  fields (Shipment ID and Sample ID shown in Figma)? → A: Sample ID only -
  Shipment ID is for outgoing distributions, not incoming samples
- Q: Should the system capture which external organization (e.g., WHO, CAP,
  National Reference Lab) sent the EQA sample? → A: Yes - Add EQA Provider field
  to track the sending organization
- Q: Should the system capture the laboratory's participant ID assigned by the
  EQA provider? → A: Yes - Add as optional field for result submission
  traceability
- Q: How should supervisors be notified when critical alerts escalate after 4
  hours? → A: Dashboard badge + in-app notification using Carbon
  ToastNotification

### Session 2025-11-18

- Q: How should Levey-Jennings charts be generated for internal control reports?
  → A: Generate LJ charts automatically with configurable control limits (2SD
  and 3SD) and display them in QC reports
- Q: Which Westgard rules should be implemented for quality control pass/fail
  determination? → A: Implement core Westgard rules (1-2s, 1-3s, 2-2s, R-4s,
  4-1s, 10-x) with configurable enable/disable per test type
- Q: How should electronic signature work for QC report review? → A: Basic
  electronic signature with optional comment and audit trail (user ID,
  timestamp, IP address) without password re-entry
- Q: How should the QC comments functionality work? → A: Result-level comments
  attached to specific IC measurements with optional entry, hover display on LJ
  charts, and searchable history
- Q: How should IC frequency and type configuration work? → A: Instrument-level
  configuration where QC frequency is set per analyzer/instrument, with all
  tests on the same instrument following the same QC schedule (e.g., "Daily
  startup", "Every N samples", "Every N hours")

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Register and Process Incoming EQA Samples (Priority: P1)

A laboratory technician receives an EQA sample from an external proficiency
testing program. They need to register this sample in OpenELIS Global, ensuring
it's properly identified as an EQA sample (not a patient sample), assigned the
correct tests, and tracked against the submission deadline.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability required for any
laboratory to participate in external proficiency testing programs. Without the
ability to register and identify EQA samples, none of the other EQA workflows
are possible. This delivers immediate value by enabling basic EQA participation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by registering an EQA sample through
the sample entry workflow, verifying it appears with proper EQA indicators in
work queues, processing the sample through testing, and confirming the sample
maintains its EQA designation throughout the workflow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am on the sample entry screen, **When** I select "EQA sample"
   checkbox during patient information entry, **Then** all patient demographic
   fields become disabled with "N/A" placeholders and EQA-specific fields become
   available on the Program tab
2. **Given** I have selected "EQA sample", **When** I navigate to the Program
   tab, **Then** I must select the EQA provider organization, select an EQA
   program, enter the sample ID from the EQA provider, set a testing deadline,
   and choose a priority level (Standard/Urgent/Critical) before proceeding
3. **Given** I have registered an EQA sample, **When** I view the work queue,
   **Then** the sample displays an EQA badge/icon for visual identification and
   can be filtered separately from patient samples
4. **Given** I am processing an EQA sample, **When** I enter results, **Then**
   the system prevents result modification after the submission deadline has
   passed

---

### User Story 2 - Monitor EQA Deadlines and Alerts (Priority: P1)

A laboratory supervisor needs to monitor upcoming EQA submission deadlines
across all active EQA samples to ensure the laboratory meets proficiency testing
requirements. They receive automated alerts at critical intervals and can take
action to prioritize samples approaching their deadlines.

**Why this priority**: Deadline management is critical for EQA compliance.
Missing submission deadlines can result in failed proficiency testing
evaluations and regulatory non-compliance. This is P1 because it directly
impacts the laboratory's ability to meet external quality requirements.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by registering EQA samples with
various deadlines, verifying alert generation at 72 hours, 24 hours, and 4 hours
before deadline, and confirming that overdue samples are flagged as critical
alerts in the alerts dashboard.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have access to the alerts dashboard, **When** an EQA sample has a
   deadline within 72 hours, **Then** I see an informational alert with the
   sample lab number, deadline, and assigned section
2. **Given** an EQA sample deadline is within 24 hours, **When** I access the
   alerts dashboard, **Then** the alert severity escalates to "warning" with
   orange color coding
3. **Given** an EQA sample deadline is within 4 hours, **When** I view the
   dashboard, **Then** the alert severity becomes "critical" with red color
   coding and the sample appears in the "EQA Deadlines Today" summary tile
4. **Given** an EQA sample deadline has passed, **When** results have not been
   submitted, **Then** the sample is flagged as overdue and requires supervisor
   approval for late submission
5. **Given** I am a supervisor, **When** I filter alerts by "My Alerts",
   **Then** I see only alerts for EQA samples in my assigned lab sections
6. **Given** I acknowledge a critical alert, **When** I click "Acknowledge",
   **Then** I must provide a resolution comment and the system logs my user ID
   and timestamp

---

### User Story 3 - Create and Distribute EQA Samples to Participating Laboratories (Priority: P2)

An EQA coordinator at a reference laboratory needs to create a proficiency
testing distribution by selecting participating clinic organizations, assigning
test panels, generating appropriate barcodes and labels, and organizing samples
into shipments for distribution.

**Why this priority**: This enables laboratories to act as EQA providers, not
just participants. While important for reference laboratories running
proficiency testing programs, it's P2 because most laboratories will first need
the ability to receive and process EQA samples (P1 stories) before they act as
distributors.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating an EQA distribution for
multiple clinic organizations, verifying that the system creates separate
order/sample records for each participant, generates barcodes, and organizes
samples into draft shipments ready for physical distribution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have EQA coordinator permissions, **When** I access the "Create
   EQA Distribution" workflow, **Then** I can select multiple participating
   clinic organizations from the existing organizations list
2. **Given** I have selected participating organizations, **When** I choose an
   EQA panel template, **Then** the system creates separate order/sample records
   for each clinic with identical test assignments
3. **Given** EQA distribution samples are created, **When** I initiate batch
   barcode generation, **Then** the system generates unique barcodes following
   existing labeling standards with one order per health facility
4. **Given** distribution samples are barcoded, **When** I organize them into
   shipments, **Then** the system creates draft shipments using the existing
   shipment/box functionality with appropriate tracking documentation
5. **Given** I am finalizing a distribution, **When** fewer than 2 participating
   organizations are selected, **Then** the system prevents finalization with an
   error message requiring minimum 2 participants

---

### User Story 4 - Collect Results and Analyze EQA Performance (Priority: P2)

An EQA coordinator receives results from participating laboratories through
multiple channels (FHIR API, manual entry, CSV upload) and needs to view
automatic statistical analysis (Z-scores, means, standard deviations) to
generate performance reports for each participant.

**Why this priority**: This completes the EQA distribution cycle, enabling
reference laboratories to provide meaningful feedback to participants. It's P2
because it depends on P1 capabilities (receiving EQA samples) and P2
distribution capabilities. Statistical analysis is essential for proficiency
testing compliance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting EQA results through
different channels (API, manual entry, file upload), verifying automatic Z-score
calculation when minimum 5 participants have submitted, and generating
downloadable performance reports.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a participating laboratory has completed EQA testing, **When** they
   submit results via FHIR API, **Then** the results automatically appear in the
   EQA Management menu with submission timestamp and method
2. **Given** I am an EQA coordinator, **When** I need to enter results for a
   participant without electronic submission capability, **Then** I can manually
   enter results through a dedicated entry screen
3. **Given** I have results from multiple participants in CSV format, **When** I
   upload the file via the batch import interface, **Then** the system validates
   and imports all results with error reporting for invalid entries
4. **Given** at least 5 participants have submitted results for an EQA
   distribution, **When** I view the EQA Management dashboard, **Then** the
   system displays automatic statistical analysis including Z-scores (Z =
   (result - target) / SD), mean, and standard deviation
5. **Given** statistical analysis is complete, **When** I classify performance,
   **Then** results with |Z-score| ≤ 2.0 are marked "Acceptable", 2.0 <
   |Z-score| ≤ 3.0 are "Questionable", and |Z-score| > 3.0 are "Unacceptable"
6. **Given** EQA results and statistics are available, **When** I generate a
   performance report, **Then** the system creates a downloadable report with
   comparative analysis across all participants and individual participant
   performance breakdowns

---

### User Story 5 - Submit EQA Results to External Programs (Priority: P3)

A laboratory that participates in external EQA programs needs to submit their
testing results to the EQA provider through their preferred submission method
(FHIR API for OpenELIS-to-OpenELIS communication, or manual web interface for
other providers).

**Why this priority**: This enables seamless result submission to external EQA
providers. It's P3 because the core capability (testing EQA samples) is already
covered in P1, and this story focuses on the submission mechanism rather than
the testing workflow itself. Many laboratories may submit results through
external provider portals independently.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing an EQA sample test,
verifying results can be submitted via FHIR API with proper authentication, and
confirming submission acknowledgment is recorded in the audit trail.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have completed testing an EQA sample, **When** the EQA program is
   configured for FHIR integration, **Then** I can submit results electronically
   to the external provider's API endpoint
2. **Given** FHIR submission is not available, **When** I need to submit
   results, **Then** I can access a web form to manually report results with
   provider-specific format
3. **Given** I submit results before the deadline, **When** the submission is
   successful, **Then** the system logs the submission timestamp, method, and
   user ID in the audit trail
4. **Given** I attempt to submit results after the deadline, **When** I click
   submit, **Then** the system requires supervisor approval and mandatory
   justification comment before allowing late submission

---

### User Story 6 - Manage Comprehensive Laboratory Alerts (Priority: P2)

A laboratory supervisor needs a centralized dashboard to monitor multiple types
of time-sensitive alerts including EQA deadlines, sample expirations, STAT order
status, and unacknowledged critical results, all filtered to their assigned
laboratory sections.

**Why this priority**: This extends the alerts system beyond just EQA to cover
all time-sensitive laboratory operations. It's P2 because while EQA deadline
alerts are P1-critical, the comprehensive multi-type alert system delivers
broader operational value and requires additional development for non-EQA alert
types.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating various alert-triggering
conditions (expiring samples, STAT orders, EQA deadlines, critical results),
verifying they all appear in the centralized dashboard with appropriate severity
color coding, and confirming role-based filtering works correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I access the Laboratory Alerts dashboard, **When** the page loads,
   **Then** I see summary tiles showing counts for "Critical Alerts", "EQA
   Deadlines Today", "Overdue STAT Orders", and "Samples Expiring"
2. **Given** I am viewing the alerts table, **When** multiple alert types are
   present, **Then** each alert displays type icon, severity color coding
   (Red=Critical, Orange=High, Yellow=Medium, Blue=Low), description, lab
   section, due date, lab number, assigned user, and action buttons
3. **Given** I want to focus on my responsibilities, **When** I check the "My
   Alerts" checkbox, **Then** the table filters to show only alerts for lab
   sections I'm assigned to
4. **Given** I need to find a specific alert, **When** I use the search bar with
   a lab number, alert type, or assignment name, **Then** the table filters to
   show matching alerts
5. **Given** a sample is expiring within 7 days, **When** I view the alerts
   dashboard, **Then** I see an informational (blue) alert; at 2 days it
   escalates to warning (orange); at 1 day it becomes critical (red)
6. **Given** a STAT order is at 50% of target time, **When** it appears in the
   dashboard, **Then** it shows as informational; at 75% it becomes warning; at
   100% it becomes critical
7. **Given** I acknowledge an alert, **When** I click "Acknowledge" on a
   critical alert, **Then** I must provide a resolution comment before the alert
   is marked as resolved with my user ID and timestamp
8. **Given** a critical alert is unacknowledged for 4 hours, **When** the
   escalation timer expires, **Then** the alert automatically escalates to
   supervisor level with notification badge increment and Carbon
   ToastNotification displayed on supervisor's next login

---

### User Story 7 - Configure EQA Programs (Priority: P3)

A laboratory administrator needs to create and manage EQA programs, defining
program names, descriptions, and assigning appropriate test panels that can be
used during EQA sample registration and distribution creation.

**Why this priority**: This is administrative configuration that supports the
operational workflows in P1 and P2 stories. It's P3 because the system can
function with a minimal set of pre-configured programs, and this configuration
is infrequent compared to daily operational workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a new EQA program through
the admin interface, assigning tests and panels to it, activating the program,
and verifying it appears as a selectable option during EQA sample registration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have administrator permissions, **When** I access the EQA Program
   Management screen, **Then** I can view a list of all existing EQA programs
   with their status (active/inactive)
2. **Given** I want to create a new EQA program, **When** I click "Create
   Program", **Then** I see a modal form to enter program name, description, and
   activation status
3. **Given** I have created an EQA program, **When** I assign tests and panels
   to it, **Then** I can select from the existing test and panel catalog using
   the normal assignment interface
4. **Given** I have configured an active EQA program, **When** a technician
   registers an EQA sample, **Then** the program appears in the EQA program
   selection dropdown on the Program tab
5. **Given** I deactivate an EQA program, **When** I save the change, **Then**
   the program no longer appears in selection dropdowns but existing samples
   referencing it remain intact

---

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when an EQA sample has the same accession number as a patient
  sample?** The system must enforce unique accession number constraints across
  all sample types; EQA samples follow the same barcode generation rules and
  cannot duplicate existing accession numbers.

- **How does the system handle late result submissions after the EQA deadline
  has passed?** Results submitted after the deadline are flagged as late
  submissions, require supervisor approval with mandatory justification
  comments, and may be excluded from statistical analysis or marked separately
  in performance reports depending on EQA program rules.

- **What happens when fewer than 5 participants submit results for statistical
  analysis?** The system displays a warning that "Minimum 5 participants
  required for valid statistical analysis" and shows descriptive statistics
  (mean, SD) but marks Z-scores as "Not calculable - insufficient participants".

- **How does the system handle duplicate result submissions from the same
  participant?** Duplicate submissions overwrite previous results with a
  complete audit trail showing the original submission timestamp, original
  result value, update timestamp, updated result value, and the user who made
  the change.

- **What happens when an EQA sample is received but the EQA program is not
  configured in the system?** The sample registration workflow allows
  technicians to register the sample with a temporary "Unconfigured Program"
  placeholder, generates an alert for administrators to configure the missing
  program, and allows retroactive program assignment once configured.

- **How does the system handle EQA distributions when a participating
  organization is deactivated or removed?** Existing distribution records remain
  intact for audit purposes, but the organization no longer appears in new
  distribution creation workflows; pending shipments to deactivated
  organizations generate alerts for EQA coordinators to resolve.

- **What happens when EQA result values fall outside biologically plausible
  ranges?** The system validates numeric results against test-specific ranges
  during submission and displays a warning if values exceed expected limits,
  requiring explicit confirmation from the user before accepting the result.

- **How does the system handle timezone differences for EQA deadlines in
  multi-site deployments?** All deadlines are stored in UTC in the database and
  displayed to users in their configured local timezone; alert generation uses
  UTC-based calculations to ensure consistent deadline enforcement across sites.

- **What happens when a user attempts to modify an EQA sample's test assignments
  after distribution has been created?** The system prevents test assignment
  changes once the sample is part of a finalized distribution (status =
  "Shipped" or "Completed"); samples in "Draft" or "Prepared" status allow
  modifications with audit trail logging.

- **How does the alerts dashboard handle high-volume scenarios with hundreds of
  active alerts?** The system uses pagination (25/50/100/200 items per page),
  implements server-side filtering and sorting, and provides real-time
  auto-refresh every 60 seconds with notification count badges; alerts older
  than 30 days are automatically archived to maintain performance.
